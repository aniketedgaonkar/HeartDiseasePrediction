# HeartDiseasePrediction (Logistic Regression Model Using Python)

## Project Objective
Predicting Heart Disease chances. Training the Machine learning model on previous data and model predicting based on trained model. 
## Dataset used
<a href="https://github.com/aniketedgaonkar/HeartDiseasePrediction/blob/main/heart_disease_data.csv">Dataset</a>
## Technologies Used:-
Python and Python Libraries: For model creation and prediction.<br>
Data Sources: Utilized heart data from Excel file to derive meaningful insights.
## Project Insights 
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health parameters.<br>
The dataset includes features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.
<br>Logistic Regression was implemented as the primary model for classification, providing insights into the risk of heart disease.
